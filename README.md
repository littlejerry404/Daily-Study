To enrich my own Github journey,I'd like to write down something:
I'd just finished my data structure course today,and I made a note of binary tree,so I'd like to add it to here.

I know that it may not be very complex.But it's just a simple part of my daily life that I want to record.
For me it's just the very beginning of my coding journey,but I'm sure I can do well in it.
