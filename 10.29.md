Today, I took a Python course and gained a fresh perspective on object-oriented design in Java.

I also attempted to set up C++ and Python compilation environments in VScode instead of using DevC++ and PyCharm.

I know that I might not have added any code for a long time, but I will organize it well and upload my study content on time.
